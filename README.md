# Iteration Project

A web application created as a proof of concept, to show iterative learning and development in one place.

## Description

This project is a fully build web app created with Spring Boot, Maven, and Thymeleaf and deployed on AWS. It started as a way to apply my knowledge and to 
turn what I was working on locally into a project capable of being showcased.

As "iteration" progresses, the complexity of the page was meant to increase, albeit nothing to crazy. Therefore the development of the application surrounding
the iterations was meant to push the complexity of the project a bit further (ie connnecting pages and serving approriate views) as well.

While I may want to continue with this project, adding much more complex iteration, it was also starting to be obvious that it will be more efficient to create a more
complex project by starting a completely new project with a more thought-out design and architecture. Regardless, this project I hope will be a quick and fun interaction to anyone who happen to stumble upon it.
